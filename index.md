VillageConnect Portfolio
Overview
VillageConnect is a data analysis project to explore rural service access (healthcare, education, water, etc.) across 500 villages using Python, Pandas, SQLite, and Seaborn.
Process

Data Generation: Created a synthetic dataset with 500 entries using random sampling to simulate rural service data.
Data Cleaning: Cleaned the dataset using Pandas, handling missing values and duplicates.
Database Storage: Stored data in a SQLite database for efficient querying.
EDA: Performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns (e.g., income vs. service access).
Visualizations: Created bar, scatter, and heatmap plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
